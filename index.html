  <p class="ms1">Throughout my career, I have tried to broaden my understanding of design and experiment within the design field. I enjoy working as an independent designer and with a team as well.<br><br> I have learned that having to question
    helps in deeper understanding and develop better ideas. In my experience, I have found that time management, working to tight deadlines and constant communication is important in any industry.<br><br> In all my work, I have relished these
    challenges and used them to fuel my ambition and maintain my own high standards </p>

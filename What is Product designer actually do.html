  <span class="underline_1"></span>

  <p class="p1"> <em>After having a long journey of working as a UI/UX Designer for more than five years, I got an opportunity to work as a Product Designer. I always thought Product Designer is almost the same as UI/UX Designer. I very recently learnt I am partially right. Though as a Product Designer you apply the same design principles, you set up a process for every task â€“ there are more number of hats that you get to wear. You also work in building the entire product from designing screens to working on banners to working on Ads for marketing. Its a full stack experience and looking at the data at end of the day is the fun part in all of this!</em><br><br>
